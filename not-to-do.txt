while giving  your background, dnt overdo just tell them what they need.
dont be boring
remember to smile
the reason they ask your background, because they want to see your presentation skills.


can you speak smoothly?

Your Background should have three sections:
talk about current role.
talk about previous role.
talk about future  role and why it would be a better match for you?

Jenkins Slave Addition:
Why: to avoid master from getting overloaded in case large number of jobs.
Generally, in aster-Slave configuration, no job is executed in master
multiple slaves are setup, master is used to just enable communication between slaves.

Manage Jenkins-> Add Node -> using ssh or java webstart Fill in thhe blanks -> and thus a slave is added
======================================
Things to do with Jenkins:
Automate Jenkins Slave Provisioning

Use Jobs: Pipeline : Jobs as a Code : we have agent, node as directive
we have stages. stages are logical group of statements

Dont mess with ENV Variables
keep your pipelines small
know that there are two pipelines: scripted and declarative. Scripted was the firtst attempt at pipelines
Blue ocean GUI
Pipeline: Use shared libraries
Jenkins also has an api.go to any job and add /api , you will get the api.
Learn about CloudBees: they adopted Jenkins, they created a certificate

favorite plugins:
job config history: brings versioning to job config history
job dsl : allows to write jenkins jobs as code. first you need a seed job.
Throttle concurrent builds: fine tune how you load your agents. load is distributed between agents.
Timestamper: adds timestamp to builds

====================================
What is Groovy Sandbox Restrictions:
it is a security feature.
To avoid manual interventions by Administrators, most scripts will run in a Groov Sandbox by default,
including all Pipeline ones.
If you uncheck "Use Groovy Sandbox" then admin will have to manually approve the script executions
